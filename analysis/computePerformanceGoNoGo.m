% alarm rate, dprime index and overall percent correct. Optionally,
% if truncate is set to true, it attempts to remove trials in which
% the subject has stopped responding due to fatigue or satiety near
% the end of the run, by counting the number of responses from the
% end of the run and stopping when it hits a certain criterion lick
% count provided by [crit]
    
% Truncate based on responses to get rid of the end where mice
% doesn't lick
